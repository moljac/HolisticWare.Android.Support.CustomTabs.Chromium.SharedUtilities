HolisticWare.Android.Support.CustomTabs.Chromium.SharedUtilities


https://github.com/GoogleChrome/custom-tabs-client/tree/master/Application/src/main/java/org/chromium/customtabsclient


This repo preparation for CustomTabs implementation in Xamarin.Auth. The repo PORT - not BINDING 
of this Android java project by Google Chromium team:

https://github.com/GoogleChrome/custom-tabs-client

It is merge of several java utilities most of classes from here:

    https://github.com/GoogleChrome/custom-tabs-client/tree/master/shared

and  some from here:

    https://github.com/GoogleChrome/custom-tabs-client/tree/master/Application/src/main/java/org/chromium/customtabsclient

The nuget is available of that code and there is plan to return (copy over) the code from Xamarin.Auth 
back to that repo.

It is under HolisticWare.* until it gets stable.


Then it will be decided if it will be added to Xamarin.Android.Support,CustomTabs or be a separate nuget 
(something like Xamarin.Android.Support.CustomTabs.Utilities - personnaly preffered).
